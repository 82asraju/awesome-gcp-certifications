### Contributing
- Please contribute to making this list really awesome, exhaustive, and up to date.
- Contributing to this list is easy - adding the information in an issue would be the easiest.  
- Please provide details as required by that section.  Links, author names, date published, which certification(s) does it apply to, etc.
- For book links, preferably send a search link with the book and author name.  (Why? Using an amazon.com link assumes that all readers are in one country and using one book seller.)
